## 2026-10-21: the BOOT key opens a main menu; the fish card only shows the card

**What changed.** The way into the pages used to be: tap a fish, tap MORE on
its card (the whole card was the hit box), land on the milestones page, then
use its SETTINGS / UPGRADES buttons. The sponge and scissors sat in a toolbox
under the card. Now:

- **BOOT's short press is the home key** (`touch_port_home`, called from
  `sleep_button_poll` in firmware/main/main.c at the release of a non-chord
  press). From the tank it opens the **main menu**, from the menu it goes back
  to the tank, and from any of its pages (milestones, shop, settings, updates)
  it returns to the menu. It is ignored while the setup flow or the reset prompt
  has the glass. Hold BOOT + tap is still the reset chord.
- **The main menu** (`render_menu` / `render_menu_tap` / `render_menu_tile_rect`
  in common/render.c, layout `MENU_*` in render.h) is a 3×2 grid inside PAGE
  x 56..392, y 60..300: TANK (milestones), UPGRADES (shop), SETTINGS / SPONGE,
  SCISSORS, and an empty cell. Picking a tool closes the menu and the DONE chip
  shows. Picking the tool already in hand puts it back. A tap off the grid
  closes the menu.
- **The card** lost its MORE button (`RENDER_CARD_H` 258 → 228, so the card
  cache is 7.4 KB smaller) and the toolbox (`render_tools_hit` and
  `RENDER_TOOLS_*` are gone). A tap on the card now puts it away.
- **The milestones page** lost SETTINGS and UPGRADES. CLOSE is alone at the
  foot, centred on the bowl, and returns to the menu, as do the shop's and
  settings' CLOSE. The sand dollar on the TANK row still opens the shop.
- Sim: **SPACE** is BOOT (`sim_home`). Director: `menu [off]`.
- The top-row icons are **placeholders** (the bubbles badge). The keeper is
  drawing the real ones. To add them: put `assets/icons/menu_{tank,upgrades,settings}.png`
  (32×32, shown at 2x) in place, run `tools/gen_icons.py`, and point
  `MENU_ICON[]` in render.c at them.

**Why.** The keeper found the tap-a-fish → MORE route to settings hidden and
roundabout, and BOOT went unused. The watch's second key is BOOT on GPIO0 too
(Waveshare's ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.06 page), so one code path serves all
three boards. A board with **no PMIC** (QEMU, bring-up) used to sleep on a
BOOT short press. That is gone; the director's `deepsleep` / `poweroff` still
do it there. Every real board has the AXP2101's PWR key for sleep.

**Board status.**

| board | `make check-all` | pictured | firmware built | flashed | on the glass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.8 rect | passes (`--selftest-menu` new) | yes: snapshot sheets of menu / card / milestones | **no**: no ESP-IDF on this machine | no | no |
| 1.75C round | passes | yes | **no** | no | no |
| 2.06 watch | passes | yes | **no** | no | no |

`tools/board_sheet.py` wasn't run (no Python 3 here). The pictures came from
`--snapshot` on each board's sim, put side by side.

**Open.**
- The firmware has not been compiled. It needs `idf.py build` plus the round
  and watch `--build-only` builds, and a look at the watch `.bss` (the card
  cache shrank, nothing grew in internal RAM).
- On the glass, check that BOOT's release is felt as one press. Debounce is
  50 ms, as before. The deep-sleep wake press is waited out by the sleep code
  before the tank task runs, so it should not also open the menu. Untested.
- The real icons for TANK / UPGRADES / SETTINGS.
- `docs/media/sim-stats-card.png` still shows the old MORE button and needs a
  fresh capture. `sim-tools.png` was removed and `sim-menu.png` added.
