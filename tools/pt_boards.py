"""pt_boards.py - the boards a release ships for, and which one an image is.

0.3.0 ships one image per board (docs/BOARDS.md). The image says which board
it is for: a marker right after its app descriptor (firmware/main/
net_port_esp.c, common/version.h PT_BOARD_MARKER_OFFSET), so the release tools
read the board from the image itself - a mixed-up build dir can never publish
the 1.8's image under the bowl's name.
